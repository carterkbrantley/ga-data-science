Could be outliers are skewing the data or there is colinerarity for example. To determine if it is because of colinerarity, I will first create a correlation matrix to determine if any two variables are too closely correlated (I will define as greater than .95 correlation). I can then eliminate one of the variables if it almost has a correlation of 1 and see if afterwards there is a noraml distribution to the data set. "
