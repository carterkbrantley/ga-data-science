Project 1
In this first project you will create a framework to scope out data science projects. This framework will provide you with a guide to develop a well-articulated problem statement and analysis plan that will be robust and reproducible.
Read and evaluate the following problem statement:
Determine which free-tier customers will covert to paying customers, using demographic data collected at signup (age, gender, location, and profession) and customer useage data (days since last log in, and activity score 1 = active user, 0= inactive user) based on Hooli data from Jan-Apr 2015.
1. What is the outcome?
Answer:
2. What are the predictors/covariates?
Answer:
3. What timeframe is this data relevent for?
Answer:
4. What is the hypothesis?
Answer:
Let's get started with our dataset
1. Create a data dictionary
Answer:
Variable	Description	Type of Variable
Var 1	0 = not thing 1 = thing	categorical
Var 2	thing in unit X	continuous
We would like to explore the association between X and Y

Problem Statement
Exploratory Analysis Plan
Using the lab from a class as a guide, create an exploratory analysis plan.
1. What are the goals of the exploratory analysis?
Answer:
2a. What are the assumptions of the distribution of data?
Answer:
2b. How will determine the distribution of your data?
Answer:
3a. How might outliers impact your analysis?
Answer:
3b. How will you test for outliers?
Answer:
4a. What is colinearity?
Answer:
4b. How will you test for colinearity?
Answer:
5. What is your exploratory analysis plan?
Using the above information, write an exploratory analysis plan that would allow you or a colleague to reproduce your analysis 1 year from now.
Answer:
